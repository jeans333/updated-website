            <p>The internship was one of my most valuable experiences as I got to work closely with the developers of the project, getting to see various sides of the development process. Before going into this, I hadn't realized the importance of compromising and communication required to meet requirements of a project from both ends, to maintain the practicality and aesthetics of the interfaces. Getting the opportunity to receive direct feedback from user testing and getting to hear their perspective helped me grow as a designer. I was able to integrate their feedback to continue various iterations and continuously improve my design approaches. </p>
